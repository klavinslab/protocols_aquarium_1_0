step
  description: "Plan out how many aliquots are required" 
  note: "Approximately 20-30 aliquots will be produced from 1mL of overnight culture. Before beginning make sure that you have enough baffled flasks for the following day; approximately one flask is needed for every 30-50 aliquots produced."
end

step
  description: "Start overnight culture"
  note: "Bring a test tube with 2-10mL of YPAD liquid media to the M20 fridge."
  note: "Using a sterile pipette tip take a small amount of the desired yeast glycerol stock and add it to the test tube. Replace the glycerol stock back into the M20 as quickly as possible."
end

step
  description: "Grow up culture"
  note: "Label the test tube with the yeast strain ID, your initials, and today's date."
  note: "Place the test tube in the 30 degree shaking incubator to grow up overnight."
end 

step
  description: "Dilute the overnight culture"
  note: "Prewarm 50mL YPAD in baffled flask(s) for 15-30 minutes in the shaking incubator"
  note: "Dilute the culture using a 1:50 or 1:100 ratio with 50mL of prewarmed YPAD"
end

step: 
  description: "Put diluted cells into shaking incubator"
  note: "Wait 5-6 hours (1:50 dilution) or 6.5-8 hours (1:100 dilution) before harvesting the cells growing in the incubator"
end

step:
  description: "Spin down cells"
  note: "transfer contents of baffled flask(s) to 50mL or 250mL falcon tubes."
  note: "Spin down in large centrifuge at 3,000xg for 5 minutes at 20 degrees."
