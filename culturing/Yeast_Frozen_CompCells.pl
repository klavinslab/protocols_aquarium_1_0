step
  description: "Plan out how many aliquots are required" 
  note: "Approximately 20-30 aliquots will be produced from 1mL of overnight culture. Before beginning make sure that you have enough baffled flasks for the following day; approximately one flask is needed for every 30-50 aliquots produced."
end

step
  description: "Start overnight culture"
  note: "Bring a test tube with 2-10mL of YPAD liquid media to the M20 fridge."
  note: "Using a sterile pipette tip take a small amount of the desired yeast glycerol stock and add it to the test tube. Replace the glycerol stock back into the M20 as quickly as possible."
end

step
  description: "Grow up culture"
  note: "Label the test tube with the yeast strain ID, your initials, and today's date."
  note: "Place the test tube in the 30 degree shaking incubator to grow up overnight."
end 

step
  description: "Dilute the overnight culture"
  note: "Prewarm 50mL YPAD in baffled flask(s) for 15-30 minutes in the shaking incubator"
  note: "Dilute the culture using a 1:50 or 1:100 ratio with 50mL of prewarmed YPAD"
end

step: 
  description: "Put diluted cells into shaking incubator"
  note: "Wait 5-6 hours (1:50 dilution) or 6.5-8 hours (1:100 dilution) before harvesting the cells growing in the incubator"
end

step:
  description: "Spin down cells"
  note: "transfer contents of baffled flask(s) to 50mL or 250mL falcon tubes."
  note: "Spin down in large centrifuge at 3,000xg for 5 minutes at 20 degrees."
end

step:
  description: "Pour out the supernatant"
  note: "Make sure to not disturb the pellet. After pouring out the supernatant add 1ml of molecular grade water for every 50mL of culture originally added to the tube. Resuspend by vortexing."
end

step:
  description: "Transfer ~1.2mL of resuspended cells to epinedorf tubes."
  note: "Try to distribute cells equally among 6 or fewer 1.5mL epinedorf tubes."
end

step:
  description: "Spin down epinedorf tubes on tabletop microfuge"
  note: "Make sure the microfuge is balanced. Spine down for 10-20 seconds and remove supernatant from resulting pellet using a 1000uL pipette."
end
  
step:
  description: "Add 1mL of molecular grade water to tubes"
  note: "resuspend by vortexing, then again spin down the tubes in the microfuge and remove the supernatant."
end

step:
  description: "Resuspend the cells by vortexing the pellet(s) with Frozen Compotent Cell Solution (FCC Solution)"
  note: "Add 4 parts of FCC for every one part of cell volume in the epinedorf tubes."
end

step:
  description: "Create yeast cell aliquots"
  note: "Label 1.5 mL epinedorf tubes with the yeast strain identifier. Add 50uL of the resuspended cell and FCC solution to each tube."
end

step:
  description: "Freeze aliquots in M.80"
  note: "Place yeast strain aliquots in the appropriate box in the M.80 fridge"
