Keep the bottle capped whenever you aren't immediately pipetting in antibiotics.\n\nPipetting: for each aliquot, spin on benchtop minifuge before opening. Using a 1000 µL micropipette, add a total of %{amp_volume} mL of Ampicillin and %{kan_volume} mL of Kanamycin to the LB Agar bottle. You can add 1000 µL at a time.
