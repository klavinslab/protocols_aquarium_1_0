      note "When pipetting a small volume of liquid into a tube, place the } of the pipette tip on the side of the tube
      that you are pipetting in, so that when you release the liquid, it sticks to the side of the tube as a drop."

      tube by using a sterile technique. Be sure to use the correct pipette and set it to 4 µL before adding a tip."
