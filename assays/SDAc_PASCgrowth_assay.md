##Assay##

###### Day 1

1. For each strain pick from glycerol stock into 200 uL of LB + kan + low amp in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
2. Streak out 1 uL of each strain on LB + kan + low amp + 1 mM IPTG plates, or 1 ng/mL aTc plates depending on desired initilization state.
3. Place plates in 37 C incubator, dispose of 200 uL cultures.


###### Day 2

1. Retrieve plates form 37 C incubator, or deli fridge if the first day was skipped and desired colonies are already avaliable.
2. Pick one colony per streak into 200 uL of LB + kan + low amp in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
3. Dilute each resuspended colony 20:1 into LB + kan + low amp (10 uL into 190 uL).
4. Go to media bay and set up one 20 mL glass tube per colony with 6 mL of LB + kan + low amp, label side of each tube.
5. Inoculate media with resuspended colony by adding 1.0 uL of the 20:1 diluted sample into its respecitve LB tube.
6. Place tubes in the 30 C shaker, dispose of 200 uL cultures.
7. Parafilm plates and place in designated are in the deli fridge.

###### Day 3

1. Set up 3 mL M9 0.4% PASC cultures in glass 14 mL tubes for each culture. Place in 37 C incubator to pre-warm.
2. Set up cytometer plate by adding 50 uL of PBS to every even numbered column (or however many is enough to accomodate every strain).
3. Add 199 uL PBS to the odd numbered column (or however many is enough to accomodate every strain).
4. Add 1 uL of culture from the tall tubes to a well.
5. Label sample wells with strain number in cytometer file.
6. Run cytometer plate using the template in the Paper Assays Folder.
7. Ensure percent green is consistent with previously established results.
8. **Vigorously** vortex LB culture for 10 seconds to break up cell clumps.
9. Inoculate 30 uL of the LB overnight into a 3 mL M9 0.4% PASC culture (with 200:1 kan and 500:1 amp) in a 14 mL glass tube.
10. Moderately vortex culture (avoid splashing) for 10 seconds and sample 100 uL for initial CFU count.
11. Transfer PASC culture in 37 C shaker/incubator.
12. Plate a 10^5 serial dilution following [best practices](https://github.com/klavinslab/protocols/blob/master/assays/assay_quality_CFU_plating_best_practices.md) of the starting culture.
13. Incubate at 37 C for 14-18 hours, until sizeable colonies arise to obtain an initial CFU/mL measurement.

###### Day 4-7

1. Prepare Corning Costar 3795 (clear, round-bottom) plate by adding 180 uL to all columns of rows B through H using multichannel pipettor.
2. Remove culture from 37 C incubator.
3. Moderately vortex culture to resuspend PASC accumulated on tube walls.
4. Sample 100 uL into wells of Row A of multi-well plate.
5. Plate a serial dilution following the assay-quality CFU [protocol](https://github.com/klavinslab/protocols/blob/master/assays/assay_quality_CFU_plating_best_practices.md). If the previous day's colony count exceeded 150 at 10^5 dilution, plate both 10^5 and 10^6 dilutions.

**Continue this protocol for 96 hours from inoculation, sampling every 24 hours.**
